## Artifact Attestations Workflows

This repository showcases how to use reusable workflows with your repository to generate [artifact attestations](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-artifact-attestations-to-establish-provenance-for-builds).

Artifact attestations allow you establish build provenance for artifacts
built in your repositories.

## Background 

See the [official documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/using-artifact-attestations-to-establish-provenance-for-builds) on
using artifact attestations to establish build provenance and
the [blog post](https://github.blog/2024-05-02-introducing-artifact-attestations-now-in-public-beta/) introducing Artifact Attestations.
